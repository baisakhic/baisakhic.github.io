excerpt: 'In this paper, have studied the dependance of message on coordinated mission planning by UAVs and investigated how delay might affect the correctness and completion of the task. To do this, we have used an exemplar mission of Plume Wrapping and developed an algorithm which cna be utilized by agents in a distributed manner to make autonomous decisions and surround the plume.'

UAVs can be directed to perform multiple tasks efficiently without human intervention. This is especially useful in tasks that require group coordination since UAVs can exchange information and alter their trajectories based on dynamic data. Thus, communication in multi-UAV platoons, with the goal of mission-oriented trajectory planning, is an area of considerable interest. In this paper, we focus on message dependence in a group of UAVs in the course of completing a task. To this end, we chose the task of Plume Wrapping. Plume Wrapping is the problem of finding the shape and extent of hazardous airborne material. This is a practical problem in real world scenario which requires a fully autonomous UAV group. Communication between UAVs is essential to coordinate decisions. In this work, we show that an algorithm can be designed which ensures correctness while being robust to variable message delay.
