excerpt: 'The project downloads available copies of the popular SMBC comic and compiles them to a comic book readable format. The system crawls through the SMBC website in order to scrape data and download comics encountered. The downloaded comics are then zipped into a cbz file which is readable by comic book readers. It was developed using Python and Selenium.'
