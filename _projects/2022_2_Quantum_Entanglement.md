As part of a collaborative project, my team and I successfully designed a Discrete Event Simualtion of a Quantum Network in which a Source transmitted entangled photons to two distinct receivers. Through analysis of coincidence click rates, we conclusively demonstrated that, at certain levels of rotation, the Bell Inequality was violated, thus, showcasing the potential of quantum mechanics to enable highly secure and efficient communication.
