excerpt: 'Designed a Discrete Event Simualtion of a Quantum Network in which a Source transmitted entangled photons to two distinct receivers. Through analysis of coincidence click rates, we conclusively demonstrated that, at certain levels of rotation, the Bell Inequality was violated, thus, showcasing the potential of quantum mechanics to enable highly secure and efficient communication. Our results achieved a high rate of fidelity (90%) for non-mixed pairs, with mixed pairs showing about 70% fidelity.'
