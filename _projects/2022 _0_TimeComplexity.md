title: "Analyzing Algorithmic Time Complexity"
collection: projects
category: NCSU
date: 2022-04-10
excerpt: 'Conducted a comprehensive analysis of various algorithmic sorting techniques and compared the runtime of each technique over multiple executions over diverse data sets. We then generated a detailed mapping of the average run-time for each approach and analysed the reasoning behind our findings. Furthermore, we presented ideas on how to optimize the sorting techniques for faster processing.'
