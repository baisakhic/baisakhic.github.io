My team and I conducted a comprehensive analysis of various algorithmic sorting techniques and compared the runtime of each technique over multiple executions over diverse data sets. We then generated a detailed mapping of the average run-time for each approach and analysed the reasoning behind our findings. Furthermore, we presented ideas on how to optimize the sorting techniques for faster processing.
