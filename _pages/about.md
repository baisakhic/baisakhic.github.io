I am a PhD Candidate at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/), currently working with [Dr.Rudra Dutta](https://dutta.wordpress.ncsu.edu/). My research focuses on communication and coordination in multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) groups. UAVs are surging in popularity as a result of the versatility of their usage and the FAA estimates that millions of autonomous UAVs will soon take to the skies. 

Through my work, I have tackled challenges the UAV groups may face, such as network latency, message loss, hardware failure, potential desynchronization, trajectory conflicts etc. and have provided solutions to ensure that each agent can make autonomous decisions in a distributed manner based on state information exchanged with other platoon members, in order to successfully complete their mission. The goal of my research is to integrate UAVs into the wider aerial ecosystem such that the vision of a safe, secure, equitable unified airspace can be realized. 

Prior to pursuing a doctoral degree, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Nomura Research Institute, Financial Technologies (NRIFT)](https://www.nrifintech.com/) where I gained extensive experience in Java and Spring Framework. I earned my B.Tech. in Computer Science from Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM) in Kolkata, India.
